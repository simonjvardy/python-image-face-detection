## Deployment ##

The website was developed using VS Code & Git pushed to GitHub, which hosts the repository. I made the following steps to deploy the site:

### **Cloning python-image-face-detection** ###

#### **Prerequisites** ###

Ensure the following are installed locally on your computer:

- [Python 3.6 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [PIP3](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) Python package installer
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) Version Control
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database with pgAdmin management tool

#### **Cloning the GitHub repository** ####

- navigate to [simonjvardy/python-image-face-detection](https://github.com/simonjvardy/python-image-face-detection) GitHub repository.
- Click the **Code** button
- **Copy** the clone url in the dropdown menu
- Using your favourite IDE open up your preferred terminal.
- **Navigate** to your desired file location.

Copy the following code and input it into your terminal to clone Sportswear-Online:

```Python
git clone https://github.com/simonjvardy/python-image-face-detection.git
```

#### **Creation of a Python Virtual Environment** ####

*Note: The process may be different depending upon your own OS - please follow this [Python help guide](https://python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/library/venv.html) to understand how to create a virtual environment.*

#### **Run the application locally** ####

- To run the application, enter the following command into the terminal window:

```Python
